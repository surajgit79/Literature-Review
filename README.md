Literature Review
In a company, the mission and vision are the statements which serves as the basic building blocks for the strategic management process. Bart, Bontis & Taggar (2021) argue that the mission statements define the fundamental purpose, values, and identity of a company, while the vision statements provide guidance about what core to preserve (Core Ideology) and what future to stimulate progress toward (Envisioned Future) for long-term prospects of the company. Additionally, mission and vision serve as a compass for strategic-initiatives for providing clarity on what the company aims to achieve such as providing insights on marketing strategy and competitive positioning (Grant,2016), and how it tends to fulfill the objective, thus, their roles cannot be understated. A clear and well-defined mission and vision not only guides marketing initiatives but also informs strategic decisions aimed at achieving competitive advantage. Moreover, the company's mission and visions influence the strategy formulation and their corresponding implementation and execution in the company in diverse and numerous fields.
Firstly, company's mission and visions are directly proportional to the strategy formulation, which refers to the techniques formulated for achieving the goals and objectives of the company. There are varieties of literature which align to the above context. Luoma-aho & Jaakkola (2020) claims that aligning mission statement content with the marketing theory enhances market orientation and customer-centricity, shaping the strategy formulation. In the similar context, Grant(2016) argue that a clear mission and vision statement guide marketing strategies, informing decisions to acquire success in the market. Moreover, Mahmoud, Richey, & Roberts (2021) suggest that various factors of mission and vision including internal market orientation and cultural determinants foster a market-oriented culture within the company, influencing strategic direction and decision-making. Likewise, Bocken(2020) claims that integrating sustainability principles, i.e. the visions, into business model archetypes aligns the company's goals with societal and environmental imperatives, impacting strategic management processes. A compelling mission and vison statement drive strategic innovation and adaptation, enhancing company's resilience and competitiveness (Russo-Spena,2020). Similarly, Wang & Rafiq(2021) emphasize that when the mission and vision are aligned with the corporate citizenship values then it fosters employee commitment and drives strategic alignment. Henceforth, understanding this interplay is necessary, for company's values, guiding strategic decision making processes, resource allocation and organizational performance for long-term. Consequently, understanding the impact of company mission and visons on strategy formulation sets the stage for exploring their role in the implementation and execution of the strategic management processes.
On the other hand, the company's mission and vision statements are moving in lockstep with the implementation and execution of the formulated strategies in the strategic management process. Considering the above context, integrating environmental responsibility into mission and vision statements fosters a culture of corporate social responsibility, guiding actions and investments to achieve environmental goals alongside maintaining the financial performance of the company (Wei, Bao and Ma,2021). Moreover, the role of internal market orientation and cultural determinants in translating mission and vision into company's culture and behavior, driving employee engagement and commitment to strategy execution (Mahmoud, Richey, & Roberts, 2021). Following the similar pattern for strategy formulation, the company's mission and goals provides a roadmap for implementation phenomena, ensuring alignment with the company's goals and values (Bart, Bontis, & Taggar,2021). This literature also shows facts that mission and vison statements are the 'top rated management tool' for every strategy implementation and execution purpose. Similarly, as per Russo-Spena(2020), the mission and vision statements guide sustainable business model innovation by providing a framework for implementing sustainability initiatives and adapting to changing market dynamics. Collectively, these insights demonstrate how mission and vision statements guide strategy implementation and execution by aligning oragnisational activities with strategic objectives, fostering employee engagement, and driving company's performance.
